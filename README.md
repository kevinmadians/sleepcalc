## 📚 Sleep Science

SleepCalc is based on established sleep science principles:

- Sleep occurs in cycles of approximately 90 minutes
- Each cycle includes stages of light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep
- Waking between cycles rather than during a cycle can lead to feeling more refreshed
- The average person needs 5-6 complete sleep cycles (7.5-9 hours) per night
